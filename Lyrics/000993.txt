Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold
Ding-dong, ding-dong
That is the song
With joyful ring
All caroling (Oh, oh, ah)
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From everywhere (From everywhere)
Filling the air
Oh, how they pound (Oh, how they pound)
Raising their sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale
Gaily they ring
While people sing songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
On on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To every home
Ah, ah, ah
Ding-dong, ding-dong
Ding-dong, ding-dong
Hark how the bells (Hark how the bells)
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say (All seem to say)
Throw cares away
(We will throw cares away)
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold
Oh how they pound (Oh how they pound)
Raising their sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale
Gaily they ring
While people sing songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
On on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To every home
Ah, ah, ah
