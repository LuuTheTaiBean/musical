I had a bad week<br>
Spent the evening pretending it wasn’t that deep<br>
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over<br>
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment<br>
You know you take all of my stress right down<br>
Help me get it off my chest and out<br>
Into the ether with the rest of this mess<br>
That just keeps us depressed<br>
We forget that we’re here right now<br>
‘Coz we’re living life at a different pace<br>
Stuck in a constant race keep the pressure on<br>
You’re bound to break<br>
Something’s got to change<br>
We should just be cancelling all our plans<br>
And not give a damn<br>
If we’re missing out on what the people think is right<br>
Seeing through a picture behind the screen<br>
And forget to be, lose the conversation for the message<br>
that you'll never read<br>
I think maybe you and me<br>
Oh we should head out to the place where the music plays<br>
And then we’ll go all night<br>
Two stepping with the woman I love<br>
All my troubles turn to nothing when I’m in your eyes<br>
Electrified, we’ll keep turning up and go all night<br>
Oh we had dips and falls in our time<br>
But we know what it feels to be low then up<br>
Alone and then loved<br>
And all we need is us to go<br>
All night, night<br>
Two stepping with the woman I love<br>
Night, yeah, all we need is us<br>
Baby<br>
Sun coming up when we walk out<br>
We lost the track of time<br>
Everything that I been dealing with ain’t even cross my mind<br>
I don’t see nobody in here but us for real<br>
For you I’m blind<br>
We go anywhere<br>
It don’t take much for us to catch a vibe<br>
Come here I need to tell you something<br>
Let me whisper in your ear<br>
Do whatever to get you there I’ll put you on a Lear<br>
Private island for a month straight<br>
They’ll think you disappeared<br>
Lamb truck look good on ya<br>
I’m copping you that urus<br>
I think I’m bout ready to make love in this club<br>
Only thing I need is my drank and my drugs<br>
I done got on 10 and forgot where I was<br>
Some parts I don’t like but this part I love<br>
Only me and my guys<br>
I been having me a good time<br>
You can see it in all in my eyes<br>
Two stepping with shorty<br>
Got her rocking side to side<br>
You should let me know when you get ready to ride cause<br>
We’ll go all night<br>
Two stepping with the woman I love<br>
All my troubles turn to nothing when I’m in your eyes<br>
Electrified, we’ll keep turning up and go all night<br>
Oh we had dips and falls in our time<br>
But we know what it feels to be low then up<br>
Alone and then loved<br>
And all we need is us to go<br>
All night, night<br>
Two stepping with the woman I love<br>
Night, yeah, all we need is us to go all night<br>
Night, night<br>
Two step and with the woman I love<br>
Night, yeah, all we need is us to go all night<br>
Night, night<br>
Two step and with the woman I love<br>
Night, yeah, all we need is us to go all night<br>
