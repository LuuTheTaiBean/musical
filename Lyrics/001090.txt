No matter what they say now I?m in love,
I do it in my way cause I?m in love,
And I can keep that song out of my mind,
Whistling that silly tune all the time.
...
No matter what they say, I don?t care,
I whistle any way everywhere,
I wrote this little song on my own,
She said that I?m a genius; I?m in love,
My friends? say that I?m crazy, I?m just fine,
My neighbors stair at me, never mind,
Cause every time this sweetness of her smile,
My supersonic girl, I?m in love.
