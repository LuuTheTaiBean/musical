Give me, oh
Give me, oh, oh, oh
I see the light inside your eyes
You make me feel like I'm awake
I don't know why you make me shine
Like a star in the sky, I'm okay
I wanna take a breath
I'm falling in love, I'm falling in love
I wanna hold your hand
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
You get me high, oh yeah
Be by my side, baby yeah (I saved)
Only you can save me (I saved)
Only you can save me
I hold you tight, you blow my mind
Like a bottle of wine, I'm insane
I come alive, you drive me wild
When I kiss you at night, I'm okay
I wanna take a breath
I'm falling in love, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I wanna hold your hand
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
You get me high, oh yeah
Be by my side, baby yeah (I saved)
Only you can save me (I saved)
Only you can save me
You get me high, oh yeah
Be by my side, baby yeah (I saved)
Only you can save me (I saved)
Only you can save me
