If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world
To find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark, and you can't see
I'll be the light
To guide you, ohhh
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me
Like one, two, three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can
Count on you
Like four, three, two
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Oh yeah
Ooooh oooh
Ooooh ooooh
Yeah, yeah
If you're tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song
Beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Every day I will
Remind you, ohhh
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me
Like one, two, three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can
Count on you
Like four, three, two
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Oh yeah
Ooooh oooh
Ooooh ooooh
Yeah, yeah
You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go, never say goodbye
You know you can
Count on me
Like one, two, three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can
Count on you
Like four, three, two
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Count on me
Like one, two, three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can
Count on you
Like four, three, two
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do
Oh yeah
Ooooh oooh
Ooooh ooooh
You can count on me, 'cause
I can count on you
