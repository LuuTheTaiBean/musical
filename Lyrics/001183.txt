I've been working for the weekend
But that weekend never came
Will you pat my back tomorrow
If I break my back today?
Ay yup, yeah it's seven A.M.
And I can't seem to keep my eyes shut
Even if I get up
Even if I get beat down
Will I be fine? Na-na-na-na
If I do my time? Na-na-na-na
I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
I've been working for the weekend
But that weekend never came
Will you pat my back tomorrow
If I break my back today?
I've been going off the deep end
And my sanity's at stake
Will you pat my back tomorrow
If I break my back today?
If I break my back today? (Ay)
You know I was broke, well, I still am
Mama said if you don't work it might hit the fan
I got it, I'm on my money guard, I'm digging up bands
You cannot find me in the club unless I'm saving at Sam's
'Cause I'm a work work work work workaholic
And a guap guap guap guap guapaholic (true)
They say I've got a problem, I believe in money trees
I've been working on the weekend to cop a spot in Belize, yeah
Will you stick by? Na-na-na-na
While I do my time? Na-na-na-na
I guess we'll hang when I'm dead
I've been working for the weekend
But that weekend never came (no it didn't)
Will you pat my back tomorrow
If I break my back today?
I've been going off the deep end
And my sanity's at stake
Will you pat my back tomorrow
If I break my back today?
(Break my back today) If I break my back today?
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na (la la la la la la)
Na-na-na-na
Break my back today
Will you stick by? Na-na-na-na
While I do my time? Na-na-na-na
I guess we'll hang when I'm dead
I've been working for the weekend
But that weekend never came
Will you pat my back tomorrow
If I break my back today?
I've been working for the weekend
But that weekend never came
Will you pat my back tomorrow
If I break my back today?

And my sanity's at stake (my sanity)
Will you pat my back tomorrow
If I break my back today?
(Break my back today) If I break my back today?
