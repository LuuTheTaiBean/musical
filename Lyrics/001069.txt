Mmh, ay, mmh
Let me tell you something baby, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
I wish understood why I can't get over you at all
You push me to the side but I come a-running when you call
(Come a-running)
You step outside my life and you leave me waiting for a sign
(Waiting for you) Oh yeah
And then you come around
Give me your apologies and I don't mind
Here we go around again
One more time
Will it ever end? (Will it ever end?)
Here we go around again
It's all the same
Never gonna change (never gonna change)
I'm trying to believe
You won't go away again this time, oh no
But something deep inside
Tells me that you're gonna change your mind
(Gonna change you mind, yeah)
Well I'll never pin you down
Makes me wonder why I even try
Lord, Lord
You say you'll stick around
But somehow I know you'll say goodbye
Here we go around again (oh no, wait a minute)
One more time
Will it ever end? (Will it ever end?)
Here we go around again
It's all the same
Never gonna change (never gonna change)
Here we go around again (oh yeah, uh-huh)
One more time (oh yeah)
Will it ever end? (Yeah)
Here we go around again
It's all the same
Never gonna change
First you leave me
Then you keep me
Waiting around 'til you come back again (hey-hey)
Make your mind up
'Cause it's so tough
When I don't know if I'm with or without your love
Love, ooh baby
Your love, hey hey
Uh huh, oh yes
Here we go around again
One more time
Will it ever end? (Oh, will it ever end?)
Here we go around again (here we go, here we go)
It's all the same (around again)
Never gonna change (never gonna change)
Here we go around again
One more time
Will it ever end? (Will it ever end?)
Here we go around again (here we go, here we go)
It's all the same (Oh, no, no, no)
Here we go around again (change, oh baby)
Here we go around again (oh yeah, yeah)
Here we go around again (oh yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Here we go around, 'round again ('round again)
(With you, my friend, yeah, yeah)
Here we go around again
The end of that was, iffy
