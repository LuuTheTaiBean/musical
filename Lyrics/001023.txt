I've been hurt babe
I'm talking really broken
My trust was stolen
So now I ain't that open
When it comes to love I overthink everything too much
I'm saying thing I don't even mean
So you don't need to drive me crazy
'Cause I'll do that to myself
(Do it to myself)
I'll do that to myself
(Do it to myself)
Without anyone else
Without anyone's help
I'll turn heaven to hell
(Do it to myself)
Yeah I'll do that to myself
I quit all those games
But still I keep on losing (Keep on losing)
So hold your stories
I'm jumping to conclusions babe
When it comes to love I overthink everything too much
Start saying shit I don't even mean
So you don't need to drive me crazy
I'll do that to myself
(Do it to myself)
Yeah I'll do that to myself babe
(Do it to myself)
Without anyone else
Without anyone's help
I'll turn heaven to hell
(Do it to myself)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll do that to myself baby Hey boy
Yeah I know, know, know nobody's a saint
But I can't let, let it go, go, go
Whoa Hey boy
Yeah I know, know, know nobody's a saint
It ain't you it's me
You don't need to drive me crazy
I'll do that to myself
(Do it to myself)
Yeah I'll do that to myself babe
(Do it to myself)
Without anyone else
Without anyone's help
I'll turn heaven to hell
(Do it to myself)
Yeah I'll do that to myself
(I'll do that to myself)
I'll do that to myself babe
(I'll do that to myself)
Without anyone else
Without anyone's help
I'll turn heaven to hell
