Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass (bass, bass, bass, bass)
Yeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
All the right junk in all the right places
I see them magazines workin' that photoshop
We know that shit ain't real
Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect
From the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
And no I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into
Then go ahead and move along
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

No, I'm just playing I know y'all think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll

Then go ahead and move along
Because you know I'm all about that bass
