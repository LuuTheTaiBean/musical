Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's been a hard year, feeling the weight now
All of the hurt, all of the dirt, all of the shame now
Nothing but closed doors, I'm not gonna break down
(I rise)
See doubt is a strong drug, it gets in your bloodstream
You lose your hope, you lose your soul, you lose the whole thing
And I fought my whole life to know it won't break me
(I rise)
Ain't no way, ain't no way I'm stopping now
Gonna make my way right through the clouds
I rise
I rise
I'm gon' break my teeth and bear the pain
Gonna climb this mountain once again
I rise
I rise
I rise
I'm feeling stronger, stronger than I've been
I'll weather the storm, weather the rain, I am the lightning (lightning)
Don't need a shelter, I'm done with the hiding
(I rise)
Ain't no way, ain't no way I'm stopping now
Gonna make my way right through the clouds
I rise
I rise
I'm gon' break my teeth and bear the pain
Gonna climb this mountain once again
I rise
I rise
I rise
