There's a place I know where we should go (hey di hey di hoh)
Won't you take me there, your lady fair (hey di hey di hoh)
There's a brook nearby, the grass grows high (hey di hey di hoh)
Where we both can hide, side by side (hey di hey di hoh)
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
What a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
Sing a summer song, skip along, holi-holiday
It's a holi-holiday
There's a country fair not far from there (hey di hey di hoh)
On a carousel, the dingdong bell (hey di hey di hoh)
On the loop di loop, we swing and swoop (hey di hey di hoh)
And what else we'll do is up to you (hey di hey di hoh)
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
What a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
Sing a summer song, skip along, holi-holiday
It's a holi-holiday
Well, I'm game
Fun is the thing I'm after
Now let's a'live it up today
Get set for love and laughter
Well, let's go
Time isn't here for wasting
Life is so full of sweet sweet things
I'd like to do some tasting
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
What a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
Sing a summer song, skip along, holi-holiday
It's a holi-holiday
In the countryside we take a ride (hey di hey di hoh)
Where the stars will shine, lots of time (hey di hey di hoh)
Back of your old car we might get far (hey di hey di hoh)
In the summer breeze, we feel at ease (hey di hey di hoh)
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
What a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
Sing a summer song, skip along, holi-holiday
It's a holi-holiday, it's a holi-holiday
