Five little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, "Quack quack quack quack"
But only four little ducks came back!
Four little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, "Quack quack quack quack"
But only three little ducks came back!
Three little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, "Quack quack quack quack"
But only two little ducks came back!
Two little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away.
Mother duck said, "Quack quack quack quack"
But only one little duck came back!
One little duck went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, "Quack quack quack quack"
But no little ducks came back!
Sad mother duck went out one day
Over the hill and far away
The sad mother duck said, "Quack quack quack quack"
And all of the five little ducks came back!
