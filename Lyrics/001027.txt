Baby why’d you say that?
Why you acting strange?
You and I go all the way back, I don’t want us to change
Baby we’ve been drinking all night
Maybe you were thinking it was so nice
But baby don’t say that, I don’t want us to change
Don’t say a word, don’t say that I love you
I forgot I have you, even though I know I won’t do
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I know that if I stay tonight I’ll fall in deeper
And the longer I’m by your side the harder it is to leave you
Baby we’ve been drinking all night
Maybe you were thinking it was so nice
But baby don’t say that, I don’t want us to change
Don’t say a word, don’t say that I love you
I forgot I have you, even though I know I won’t do
Don’t say a word, forget your hurt
I know I’m telling you I love you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Don’t say a word, don’t say that I love you
I forgot I have you, even though I know I won’t do
