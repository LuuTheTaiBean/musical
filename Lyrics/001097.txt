Living inside and waiting for the night
Living it up when someone gets the light
My body will go where music goes
Where I can lose control
Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up 
Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up 
Taking it in and begging for some more
Spinning around and slowin (?) cross the floor
I'm gonna be where music shows
The color of every soul
Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up 
Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up 
In the night I'm never lonely
Out of sight I'm never lonely
Never lonely
Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up
Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up
