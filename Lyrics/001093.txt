Just like a bird
I'll fly away to you
Just hold me close
You don't have to say a word
Keep me next to you so I don't feel this way
I hope I'll be enough for you one day
Just like a bird
I'll fly away to you
Just hold me close
You don't have to say a word
Keep me next to you so I don't feel this way
I hope I'll be enough for you one day
Just like a bird
I'll fly away to you
Just hold me close
You don't have to say a word
Keep me next to you so I don't feel this way
I hope I'll be enough for you one day
Just like a bird
I'll fly away to you
Just hold me close
You don't have to say a word
Keep me next to you so I don't feel this way
I hope I'll be enough for you one day
