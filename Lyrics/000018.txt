Let the might of your compassion arise to bring a quick and
To the flowing stream of the blood and tears 
They are drunk with demonic delusions
What is right and what is wrong?
Oh you playing games, playing games, hurting my soul
Seven days, seven nights, without control
Oh every day, every night I was alone
When you're not next to me
Should I listen to my heart, girl
Should I listen to my brain
When you tell me, you leave me, and you give it up
Can't we still be friends?
Oh after your love is gone
I don't know where I belong
When you're not next to me, not next to me
I'm dying, crying baby
Oh, after your love is gone
Oh baby I'm so alone
When you not next to me, it's ecstasy
I'm dying, crying baby
In the ocean of joy
They are drunk with demonic delusions
Oh you playing games, playing games, playing with love
You can run but don't hide, can't get enough
Anyway, anywhere, I'll be there
Cause you're the one for me
Cause when I give you all my heart girl
You know I will die for you
And when you tell me, you'll leave me, and you give it up
I lose my destiny
Oh after your love is gone
I don't know where I belong
When you're not next to me, not next to me
I'm dying, crying baby
Oh, after your love is gone
Oh baby I'm so alone
When you not next to me, it's ecstasy
I'm dying, crying baby
Oh after your love is gone
I don't know where I belong
When you're not next to me, not next to me
I'm dying, crying baby
Oh, after your love is gone
Oh baby I'm so alone
When you not next to me, it's ecstasy
I'm dying, crying baby
In the ocean of joy
They are drunk with demonic delusions
What is right and what is wrong?
