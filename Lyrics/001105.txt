Oh it's a long way down
But if you don't look, you don't have to know it
And I could be around
To catch your fall if you're losing your grip
Can't you see that I'd come crawling on my knees
To get to you, get to you, get to you
Can't you see that I'd climb mountains just to be
Next to you, next to you, next to you
But do you love like I love you?
Don't have to rush if you don't want to
Oh I'll be patient
But just know that there's no way
That anybody else could love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
Love you
Like I love you
Love you
Know you've been hurt before ('fore, 'fore, 'fore, 'fore)
But a little love is enough to save ya
Yeah, we could take our time for sure
'Cause something real is worth for waiting
Can't you see that I'd come crawling on my knees
To get to you, get to you, get to you
Can't you see I'd swim the ocean just to be
Next to you, next to you, next to you
But do you love like I love you?
Don't have to rush if you don't want to
Oh I'll be patient
But just know that there's no way
That anybody else could love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
Love you
Like I love you
Love you
I know you wanted me but
She won't surrender your heart
Keeping me out in the dark, keeping me out in the dark
I know you wanted me but
She won't surrender your heart
Keeping me out in the dark, keeping me out in the dark
In the dark
Do you love like I love you?
Don't have to rush if you don't want to
Oh I'll be patient
But just know that there's no way
That anybody else could love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
(Nobody else could love you)
Love you (like I love you)
(Nobody else could love you)
Like I love you
(Nobody else could love you like I love you)
Love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
