Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I don't know how long I'll stay for
It's okay, I'll knock on your door
Won't you come down and get me?
I like it when you hold me
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't know how long I'll stay for
It's okay, I'll knock on your door
Won't you come down and get me?
I like it when you hold me
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
