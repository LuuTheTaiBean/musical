They said I needed something in my life
Said I was doing dumb shit all the time
'Cause broken dreams won't pay your bills at all
I heard it was the wrong things I get right
I'm blamin' all the monsters in my mind
With stories from outside this prison walls
'Cause even if we are hopeless
We know that this will hurt
Tomorrow is just a blur
That they can't control
Believers
Let's raise a toast
Enjoy the show
Yeah, believers
So incomplete
Yet all we need
Believers
Let's raise a toast
Enjoy the show
They said I wanna come, but I'm terrified
Headed for the sun but I'm scared of heights
So you and me go fallin' through the dark (no, no)
You told me to be someone that I like
Instead of being someone in their eyes
Your battle scars make you look like a star
'Cause even if we're hopeless
We know that this will hurt
Tomorrow is just a blur
That they can't control
Believers
Let's raise a toast
Enjoy the show
Yeah, believers
So incomplete
Yeah, all we need
(We are) Believers
Let's raise a toast
Enjoy the show
I want you to know that, believer
They can't control it, believer
I want you to know that, believer
They can't control it (they can't)
I want you to know that, believer
They can't control it, believer
I want you to know that, believer
They can't control it
No, they can't control it, ooh, ooh
