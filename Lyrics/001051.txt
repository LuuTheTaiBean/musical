 I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away
I've been on my own for a minute
Is it only me out here
Searching for the place to begin it
Is it me? Is it you? Is it fear?
Standing on the line I was given
People stare and ask me why I'm here
No one seems to think that I fit in
But I don't wanna be like them
No, 'cause I don't wanna be like them
'Cause I know that I, know that I
I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh
Oh-oh, woah, oh, I'd fly away
No one knew how low I was feeling
I was scared to reach it all
Knowing I was here for a reason
But I was scared that if I tried, I'd fall
So where do I go now I'm in it?
I never thought it'd be like this
Dreaming all my life and I did it
Thought the grass was greener than then it is
'Cause I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh
Oh-oh, woah, oh, I'd fly away
Oh, woah, woah, oh I'd fly away
'Cause I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh
Oh-oh, woah (fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away)
Woah, woah, woah (fy away, fly away, fly away)
I'd fly away
