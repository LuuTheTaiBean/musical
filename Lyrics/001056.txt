Empty heart and empty soul
A lover on remote control
All colors fade to grey
The more they play this love charade
Why don't you see, why don't you feel that love is free?
Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
All alone in Tokyo
Don't you see, don't you know,
They have nowhere else to go
Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
Far away from Tokyo,
They believe in geisha dreams
Perfect body and perfect smile
An illusion for awhile
Born to love and trained to please
And paid to put your mind at ease
But don't you see, but don't you feel that love is free?
Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
All alone in Tokyo
Don't you see, don't you know,
They have nowhere else to go
Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
Far away from Tokyo,
They believe in geisha dreams
All your love and hopes and dreams,
All you feel down deep inside ain't real
Don't come for anything,
'Cause geisha dreams aren't meant to be
Why don't you see, why don't you feel that love is free?
Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
All alone in Tokyo
Don't you see, don't you know,
They have nowhere else to go
Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
Far away from Tokyo,
They believe in geisha dreams
