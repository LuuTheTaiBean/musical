Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sunken in the wind, listening to the thunder rolling over and over, we
Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sunken in the wind, listening to the thunder rolling over and over
We down
We're getting on fire
We're raising up higher
The bottle is up
We're over the top
It's time to get vile
The time our life
Is happenin' now
We're out of control
Together we're rolling, over and over, we
Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sunken in the wind, listening to the thunder rolling over and over, we
Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sunken in the wind, listening to the thunder rolling over and over, we
Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sunken in the wind, listening to the thunder rolling over and over, we
Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sun get in the wind is sent to the thunder
We gotta rock, rock
Party 'til the last shot
Fill that jug and raise your cup up
We gotta chug, chug
Better take it, don't stop
Hey, come drink until the last drop
So please, just let us burn down this place
And we will end up in the hall of fame
Let's get ready for the drinking games
So come and sip until the last drop
Over and over, we
Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sunken in the wind, listening to the thunder rolling over and over, we
Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sunken in the wind, listening to the thunder rolling over and over, we
Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sunken in the wind, listening to the thunder rolling over and over, we
Down the river, we're drunk and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sun get in the wind is sent to the thunder
