'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars<br>
I'm gonna give you my heart<br>
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars<br>

I don't care, go on and tear me apart<br>
I don't care if you do, oo-oo, oo-oo<br>
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars<br>
I think I saw you<br>
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars (full of stars)<br>
I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh<br>
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark (gets dark)<br>
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh<br>
I don't care, go on and tear me apart<br>
I don't care if you do, oo-oo, oo-oo<br>
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in sky full of stars<br>
I think I see you<br>
I think I see you<br>
'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars<br>
Such a heavenly view<br>
You're such a heavenly view<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh<br>
