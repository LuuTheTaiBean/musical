You, you came with a warning
I should have seen it
My bad for falling
I'm, I'm far from perfect
But I know what my worth is
More than you're giving
What goes up, comes back down
What goes out, comes around
You're so dumb and reckless
You already wrecked this
What goes up, comes back down
And your day we'll come around
I don't wanna fix this
You already wrecked this
For good
You already wrecked this
Wooh-oh-oh-oh
For good
Wooh-oh-oh-oh
Count me out I'm leaving
All 'cause you cheated
I wasn't playing
Now this time I live with
My head up winning
Don't feel like crying
What goes up, comes back down
What goes out, comes around
Oh
What goes up, comes back down
In your day we'll come around
Oh, no
What goes up, comes back down
What goes out, comes around
You're so dumb and reckless
You already wrecked this
What goes up, comes back down
And your day we'll come around
I don't wanna fix this
You already wrecked this
For good
