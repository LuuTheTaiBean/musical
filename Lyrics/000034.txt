Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
My mind feels like a foreign land (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Silence ringing inside my head (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Do you love me, or love me not?
Peeling piecеs from my heart
And my rose-colored lеns is gone
Still I carry, I carry, I carry on
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
