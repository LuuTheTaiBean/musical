I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive
'Cuz everytime we touch,
I get this feeling,
& Everytime we kiss,
I swear I could fly,
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last,
Need you by my side.
'Cause every time we touch,
I feel this static,
And every time we kiss,
I reach for the sky,
Can't you hear my heart beat so,
I can't let you go,
Want you in my life.
Your arms are my castle
Your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry
The good and the bad times
We've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall
'Cuz every time we touch,
I get this feeling,
And every time we kiss,
I swear i can fly,
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last,
Need you by my side
'Cuz every time we touch,
I feel this static,
And every time we kiss,
I reach for the sky,
Can't you hear my heart beat so,
I can't let you go,
Want you in my life,
'Cause every time we touch,
I get this feeling,
And every time we kiss,
I swear I could fly,
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last,
Need you by my side.
