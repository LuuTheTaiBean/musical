You keep chasing stars
Lost in the oceans
Dreams and confusion
You keep chasing stars
Keep falling faster, straight for disaster
Chasing stars, oh woah
You keep chasing stars
Lost in the oceans
Dreams and confusion
You keep chasing stars
Keep falling faster, straight for disaster
Chasing stars, oh woah
Chasing stars
Chasing stars
Chasing
Chasing
Chasing
