We've seen a million places
Touched a million skies
They say there ain't a good without goodbye
Oh you and me we sometimes seem like day and night
But you should know that I
I'll keep you right by my side
Till the day I die
Till the day I die
Keep you right by
Keep you right by my side
Till the day I die
Till the end of time
Such a wild ride
Till the day I die
We've seen a million places
Touched a million skies
They say there ain't a good without goodbye
Oh you and me we sometimes seem like day and night
But you should know that I
I'll keep you right by my side
Till the day I die
Till the day I die
Keep you right by
Keep you right by my side
Till the day I die
Till the end of time
Such a wild ride
Till the day I die
Till the day I die
