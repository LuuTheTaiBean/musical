Am I living?
Oh, what a funny thing to say
But there's alive, and then there's living
Am I living for today? Hmm
And I'm getting older
With every memory I make
Now that I'm older, with these moments
Will I live with them or just throw them away, away?
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day"
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day, on a cloudy day"
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day, on a cloudy day"
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day" (on a cloudy day)
And am I wiser?
For holding close the friends I make
But if I'm wise, then why this feeling
Of a trial that I can't shake?
And I'm getting older
With every memory I make
Now that I'm older, with these moments
Will I live with them or just throw them away, away?
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day"
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day, on a cloudy day"
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day" (on a cloudy day)
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day"
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day"
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day" (on a cloudy day)
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day" (ooh, ooh)
But your momma always said, "Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day" (day, day, day)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
On a cloudy day
