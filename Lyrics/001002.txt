Put me up, take my heart and make me happy
Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, fill my heart and make me happy
Here we go, gettin' smooth to the groove
Watching lovely ladies, as I smooth as I move
'Cause that's what they say but I can't prove
So turn it up again and watch me move to the groove
As we get close, you whisper "Coco"
I hold you in my arms and you say "Jamboo"
Scream and shout, turn and say "Colombo"
Now I gotta go, so coco
Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take my heart and make me happy
