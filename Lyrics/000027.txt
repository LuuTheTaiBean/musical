Lady I know it will hurt
But it's much harder to ignore
There is a chance and I promise
I won't hurt you anymore
Hollywood nights were romancin'
You can trust me anytime
Somewhere oh babe there is someone
Oh you're dancin' in my mind
Oh oh oh little queenie
I'm your fool come on
Teach me the rules
I will send an S.O.S. for love
Oh oh oh little queenie
I'm your fool you need love Like I do
I will send an S.O.S. for love'
Atlantis is calling
S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling
From the stars above
Atlantis is calling
S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling
It's too hot to stop
If loving you is wrong, babe
Oh, I don't wanna be right
I've got you under my skin, babe
And baby, hold me tight
I'm ready for our romance
I wait a millon years for you
I love you more than I'm saying
Baby, that's for me the truth
Oh oh oh little queenie
I'm your fool come on
Teach me the rules
I will send an S.O.S. for love
Oh oh oh little queenie
I'm your fool you need love Like I do
I will send an S.O.S. for love'
Atlantis is calling
S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling
From the stars above
Atlantis is calling
S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling
From the stars above
Atlantis is calling
S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling
It's too hot to stop
Atlantis is calling
S.O.S. for love
