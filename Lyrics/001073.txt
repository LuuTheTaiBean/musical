I love you 
Under my skin, under my skin
Got me struggling to know where you end and where I begin
And we feel incredible, we feel no pain
You got me feeling insane
Got me struggling to know where you end and where I begin
Had my head under water
Had my mind under covers
Had my faith in the gutter
Under water, water, water, water, water
But when you look at me
I’m higher, higher, higher
Eyes on me
I’m higher, higher, higher
Noting matters at all 
When I see you with your
Eyes on me 
I’m higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher 
Imma pop out wid it, no lie
Imma get it wet oh baby, we slide
Head in the clouds when I look in your eyes 
I don’t got a doubt in the back of my mind
That you got it, got it, got it all (got it, got it, got it all)
And you know it’s you that drives me crazy (know it’s you that drives me crazy)
Had my head under water
Had my mind under covers
Had my faith in the gutter
Under water, water, water, water, water 
But when you look at me
I’m higher, higher, higher
Eyes on me
I’m higher, higher, higher
Noting matters at all 
When I see you with your 
Eyes on me 
I’m higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher 
Had my head under water
Had my mind under cover
Had my faith in the gutter
Under water, water, water, water, water 
But when you look at me
I’m higher, higher, higher
Eyes on me
I’m higher, higher, higher
Noting matters at all 
When I see you with your 
Eyes on me 
I’m higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher,
Higher, higher, higher 
I love you
