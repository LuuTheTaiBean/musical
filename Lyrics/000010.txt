I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky<br>
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights<br>
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight<br>
Are you with me, are you with me?<br>
Are you with me?<br>
Are you with me?<br>
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights<br>
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight<br>
Are you with me, are you with me?<br>
I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky<br>
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights<br>
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight<br>
Are you with me, are you with me?<br>
Are you with me?<br>
I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky<br>
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights<br>
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight<br>
Are you with me, are you with me?<br>
I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky<br>
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights<br>
