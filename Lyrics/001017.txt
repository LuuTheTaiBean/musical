 Friend of mine
Is a black suitcase and a frowny face
Had a life
And now my eyes are glazed 'cause they dug my grave
All I wanna do is shake my head
Shake my head, shake my head
But how am I gonna do that with a broken neck?
A broken neck, guess I ain't like them
(Guess I ain't like them)
All I wanna do is
All I wanna do is
I'm just a dead girl, don't live in your world
I just roll my eyes back every time I hear that
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm about to lose a friend
I'm just a dead girl
Ain't even mad though
I just roll my еyes back every timе I hear that
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm just a dead girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh, d-d-dead girl
Drag my feet
Like a zombie now, do I freak you out? (Ah)
Come at me
You don't hear no sound when you're six feet down, down, down (oh)
All I wanna do is shake my head
Shake my head, shake my head
But how am I gonna do that with a broken neck?
A broken neck, guess I ain't like them
(Guess I ain't like them)
All I wanna do is
All I wanna do is
All I wanna do is
All I wanna do is
I'm just a dead girl, don't live in your world
I just roll my eyes back every time I hear that
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm about to lose a friend
I'm just a dead girl (dead girl)
Ain't even mad though
I just roll my eyes back every time I hear that
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm just a dead girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh, d-d-dead girl
