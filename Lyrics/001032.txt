Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo (echo)
Promised you would never leave me
Oh, how I hold on to those words
Since you've been gone it isn't easy
And late at night it's getting worse
Memories, hard to erase
Everywhere I see your face
Your face
It's a blessing and a curse
I wanna see you but it hurts
It hurts
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Causе wherever I go
I can hеar your echo
Bring me back so I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo, echo, echo
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring me back so I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring me back so I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo, echo, echo
They say that nothing last forever
But they don't really tell you why
Just one more chance and do it over
I wish we had a bit more time
Memories, hard to erase
Everywhere I see your face
Your face
It's a blessing and a curse
I wanna see you but it hurts
It hurts
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring me back so I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo, echo, echo
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring me back so I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring me back so I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo (echo)
Echo, echo
Echo, echo
Echo, echo
Echo, echo
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo
