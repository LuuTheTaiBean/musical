Hi kids
Let's shake our body
Come on
Dance to the tune
Workout is a boon
We are healthy soon
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
And eyes, and ears, and mouth, and nose
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
March, march, march
Let's all march
March, march, march
Get your body charged
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
And eyes, and ears, and mouth, and nose
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
Jump, jump, jump
Let's all jump
Jump, jump, jump
Make your muscle pump
Punch, punch, punch
Let's all punch
Punch, punch, punch
Have a hearty munch
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
And eyes, and ears, and mouth, and nose
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
