I, I never thought I'd be your type
Ah, ah, I, on my mind
The kind of love I can't describe
Ah, ah, I
You got me running, oh no
Away from our history, oh no
And through the darkness, oh no
Oh, I can see you with me
When you find a love that's right
You can drive all night, drive all night, yeah
Ah, do what makes you feel alive
You can drive all night, drive all night
'Cause the road's calling
Over again, ride 'til the morning
Ride 'til the end, oh
When you find a love that's right
You can drive all night, drive all night
Faith, remember how we were back then
Ah, ah, I, I get
Fake, emotions that can't comprehend
Ah, ah, I
You got me running, oh no
Away from our history, oh no
And through the darkness, oh no
Oh, I can see you with me (oh no)
when you find a love that's right
You can drive all night, drive all night, yeah
Ah, do what makes you feel alive
You can drive all night, drive all night
'Cause the road's calling
Over again, ride 'til the morning
Ride 'til the end, oh
When you find a love that's right
You can drive all night, drive all night
You and me, history
I'm running from the rest of my life
Through the darkness, I see your eyes and realize that I
That I
when you find a love that's right
You can drive all night, drive all night (drive all night)
Ah, do what makes you feel alive
You can drive all night, drive all night (drive all night)
'Cause the road's calling
Over again, ride 'til the morning
Ride 'til the end, oh
When you find a love that's right
You can drive all night, drive all night
Drive all night
