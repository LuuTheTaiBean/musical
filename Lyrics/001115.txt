I gotta break it to you, mi amor
I saw you light up like a flame
When I walked in, took your breath away
Feels good to know that you still
Got feelings, you still feel it (mmm)
Like you can't get enough
Can't believe this glow up
I like attention so oh, here we go again
I gotta break it to you, mi amor
I'm not the person that I was before
I'm turning tables on you, mi amor
If you want another chance
Show me a different dance
Ma ma, mi amor
Ma ma, mi amor
I'm unforgettable
Ma ma, mi amor
Too many nights I stayed at home
With tiny teardrops falling on the phone
Then I woke up, realized I'm a queen and
I don't need him (mmm)
Got good friends around me
Confident and happy
Like the attention, so oh, here we go again
I gotta break it to you, mi amor
I'm not the person that I was before
I'm turning tables on you, mi amor
If you want another chance
Show me a different dance
Ma ma, mi amor
Ma ma, mi amor
I'm unforgettable
Ma ma, mi amor
Can you feel it?
Two hearts beating (two hearts beating, yeah)
Something's different
We all make mistakes, maybe this is not too late
I gotta break it to you, mi amor
I'm not the person that I was before
I'm turning tables on you, mi amor
If you want another chance
Show me a different dance
Ma ma, mi amor
Ma ma, mi amor
I'm unforgettable
Ma ma, mi amor
Ma ma, mi amor
